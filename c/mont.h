// To implement and benchmark:
// - Non-SIMD CIOS (32-bit limbs in arrays of uint64_t) from Acar (see Mrabet et al)
// - Non-SIMD CIOS (51-bit limbs in arrays of doubles) from BM17
// - SIMD CIOS (51-bit limbs in arrays of doubles) from BM17
// - Non-SIMD CIOS (30-bit limbs in arrays of uint64_t) from Mitscha-Baude
